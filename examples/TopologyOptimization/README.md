# Topology Optimization with YetAnotherFEcode

This folder contains basic examples to demonstrate the use of [YetAnotherFEcode](https://github.com/jain-shobhit/YetAnotherFEcode) for Topology Optimization problems. The source files are located in the `src/TopologyOptimization` folder.

## Examples

The following examples are provided:

1. `ComplianceMinimization.m`: compliance minimization of the MBB beam structure subjected to a volume constraint using the Method of Moving Asymptotes (MMA).

2. `ElectrostaticOptimization.m`: electrostatic compliance minimization (agave problem) subjected to a volume constraint using the Method of Moving Asymptotes (MMA).

3. `FrequencyMaximization.m`: frequency maximization of a clamped-clamped resonator subjected to a volume constraint using the Method of Moving Asymptotes (MMA).
